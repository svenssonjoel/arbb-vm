Short term TODO items
---------------------
* Implement limited Fold functionality  in ArBB back-end
     - Fix strange behaviour in corner case of reduce 1D to 0D 
* Code cleanup 
* Bug hunting (some are starting to surface) 
    - reverse of env in genExp (a hack) 
* Run some simple benchmarks
    - SAXPY
    - DotProd 
    - Matrix Add (Should also be possible) 





Long term TODO items 
--------------------
* The "Partner" arrays allocated on Haskell side should be allocated 
  of minimum size!

* Implement more complete Fold functionality in ArBB back-end
    - Fold using function f 

* Expand Accelerate ArBB back-end functionality beyond map, zipwith, fold
  - Permutations 
  - scans 
 
* Reference counting on arrays managed in the back-end
   - Free arrays when possible 
* Generalize genBFun and genMap (They are the same concept, should be fused) 
* Investigate if "uploading" data at "Use" points is a good idea.
    Doing so imposes a restriction on dimensionality already at that point.
* Work on a "non-immediate" mode ArBB back-end 
    - generate larger functions and give the ArBB optimization passes more 
      to work on.
