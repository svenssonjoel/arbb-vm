Long term TODO items 
--------------------
* implement more complete Fold functionality in ArBB back-end
* expand Accelerate ArBB back-end functionality beyond map, zipwith, fold
* Reference counting on arrays managed in the back-end
   - Free arrays when possible 
* Generalize genBFun and genMap (They are the same concept, should be fused) 
* Investigate if "uploading" data at "Use" points is a good idea.
    Doing so imposes a restriction on dimensionality already at that point.
