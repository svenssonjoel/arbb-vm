# The accelerate darcs repository can be checked out here in the working
# copy, mixing 

# Unfortunately, darcs is finicky and won't let you check out to an
# existing directory directly.  Below is a series of commands to
# accomplish the checkout:

darcs get http://code.haskell.org/accelerate 
(cd accelerate; tar czvf accelerate.tgz *)
tar xzvf accelerate/accelerate.tgz
rm -rf accelerate/
  
# In this git repository howover, we will only track the files relevant
# to our ArBB experiment.
