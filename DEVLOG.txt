Joel and I talked about issues having to do with managing pointers to
ArBB garbage collected data, which uses reference counting.  Haskell
ForeignPtr's could, in their finalizer, call a reference count
decrement function on the ArBB side if that is necessary.

Entry by Joel Svensson: 
Swapped out the files that were in the repo for a new attempt. 
This version uses an alternative header file called arbb_alt.h 
(I placed that in cbits, it is now the only thing in cbits). 
With this approach the wrappers are nolonger needed.  
arbb_alt.h simply gives alternative type signatures to all the 
calls available in the arbb vm.
If the original arbb-vmapi.h header specifies a struct containing 
a pointer to void, the alternative says just pointer to void.
